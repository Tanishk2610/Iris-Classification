# Iris Classification
I collect this dataset from Kaggle.   
Features:-This dataset has 4 Features SepalLengthCm, SepalWidthCm, PetalLengthCm, PetalWidthCm.
In this dataset label(Species) has 3 Categaries Iris-setosa, Iris-versicolor, Iris-virginica.
On this basis we have to predict the Specis of the Flower.
For this I use Logistic-Regression Algorithem (which is the classification algorithem of Machine Learning) to prdict the Species of the flower based on Features.
